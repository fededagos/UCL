# UCL
This repository contains a collection of coursework from my MSc in Machine Learning at UCL (2021/2022).
Content of the various folders ranges from reports, paper reviews, coding exercises and end-to-end projects.

Below is a summary of the various topics tackled in the various projects present here.

## Supervised Learning
Kernelisation of algorithms, sample complexity analysis, study of generalisation behaviour of common algorithms (perceptron, winnow, knn,...).
Kernel perceptron from-scratch implementation and analysis on MNIST.

## Statistical Natural Language Processing
Group project on argument mining (argument component identification to be precise). The full codebase for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/namiyousef/argument-mining).

## Machine Learning Seminar
Review of [Deep Kernel Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02222).
Group presentation on [Neural Importance Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03856)

## Reinforcement learning
Miscellaneous coursework covering the entire module, from bandit algorithms to Deep Reinforcement learning using [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) and [haiku](https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku).

## Graphical models
Summative coursework on Bayesian Belief Networks, inference on graphs, LDPC codes and more.

## Bayesian Deep learning
Bayesian classifiers and posterior approximation. Variational Autoencoders. Uncertainty quantification and calibration in pre-trained Deep Neural Networks.

## Applied Machine learning
From-scratch implementation of CART trees, random forests, ADAboost, Support Vector Machines.
